# resume_parser
This project is a Resume Parsing System that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automatically extract relevant information from resumes in PDF format. The system reads unstructured resume data and transforms it into a structured format (e.g., JSON or CSV). It can identify sections like name, contact details, technical skills, education, work experience, and certifications, using machine learning and NLP techniques.This automation helps in accelerating and improving the efficiency of the recruitment process, especially in organizations dealing with large volumes of resumes.

USES:
  * Reduces time and effort in manually reviewing resumes
  * Can be integrated into HR software or Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)
  * Helps in generating structured candidate data for analysis
  * Assists in shortlisting candidates based on required skills or experience
  * Demonstrates practical implementation of NLP and real-world data extraction
